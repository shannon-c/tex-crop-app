## ðŸš€ Tex Crop - Crop Yield Management App

Tex Crop aims to increase crop yield (Specifically Rice and Palm Oil Production) of farmers in Malaysia. Rice is the staple food of Southeast Asia while Palm Oil has boosted the economy of Malaysia since the 90-era. To manage a large-scale plantation efficiently, a digitalization process is required. This is where Tex Crop is crafted, it allows farmers to recycle their plantation waste, ask for farming services, and view reports of their plantation.
